License texts are accessible from Privacy and help → Licenses. This standalone app is not affiliated with Omi or Based Hardware. Owner-local Omi Private supplied selectively reused native build/model/adapter patterns; its BLE, PC/cloud/sync, credentials and key material were not copied for this migration.

Releases through 0.3.3 used Vosk alone. Release 0.4.0 replaced live recognition with Whisper and excluded Vosk/JNA. Release 0.4.1 restores the pinned Vosk/JNA runtime for streaming drafts and retains Whisper for post-save refinement. Public `test.wav` and `jfk.wav` fixtures are test-only, not shipped release recordings.
